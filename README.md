## 🔐 Authentication Flow

## 🤖 AI Features

While creating or editing an article, an AI toolbar provides the following actions powered by the backend Gemini integration:

| Button           | Mode      | What it does                                   |
| ---------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ✨ Improve       | `improve` | Rewrites content for clarity and structure     |
| ✓ Grammar        | `grammar` | Fixes grammar and punctuation errors           |
| ↓ Concise        | `concise` | Shortens content while preserving meaning      |
| 💡 Suggest Title | `title`   | Returns 3 better title options to choose from  |
| 🏷 Suggest Tags  | `tags`    | Auto-fills the tags field with 5 relevant tags |

**AI Summary on Article Cards:**

- Summary is auto-generated by the backend when an article is saved
- Displayed as a short excerpt on every article card on the home page
- No action needed from the user — it appears automatically

---

## 🎨 UI & Design Decisions

- Reusable components (Loader, EmptyState)
- Clean card-based layout
- Toast notifications instead of alerts
- Integrated AI toolbar inside the editor
- Smooth animations for better UX
- Custom dark theme with amber accent colors

---

## 🔎 Search & Filtering

Users can:

- Search by title, content, or tags
- Filter articles by category
- View latest articles sorted by creation date

---

## 🧠 How AI Was Used During Development

**Claude (claude.ai)** was used as a coding assistant throughout development:

- Generating React component structure and boilerplate
- Designing the Tailwind color theme and component classes
- Building Axios interceptor logic for auth
- Designing the AI assist toolbar component and UX flow

All generated code was reviewed, tested, and manually refined for the actual project needs.
